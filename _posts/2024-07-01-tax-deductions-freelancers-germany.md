As a freelancer in Germany, understanding which expenses are tax-deductible can significantly reduce your tax burden. This comprehensive guide covers all the expenses you can deduct and how to properly document them.

## Understanding Business Expenses (Betriebsausgaben)

Business expenses are costs that are directly related to your freelance work. These expenses reduce your taxable income, which means you pay less tax. The key principle: **If an expense is necessary for your business, it's likely deductible.**

## Office and Workspace Expenses

### Home Office Deduction

If you work from home, you can deduct a portion of your rent and utilities:

**Option 1: Simplified Method (Pauschale)**
- 1,250 EUR per year (1,000 EUR for rent + 250 EUR for utilities)
- No need to calculate exact square footage
- Available if you don't have a separate office space elsewhere

**Option 2: Actual Costs Method**
- Calculate the percentage of your home used for business
- Deduct that percentage of rent, utilities, insurance, and maintenance
- Requires detailed documentation and floor plan
- More beneficial if your home office is a significant portion of your living space

**Requirements:**
- The space must be used exclusively or primarily for business
