Creating professional invoices that meet German legal requirements is essential for freelancers. This guide covers everything you need to know to create compliant invoices and maintain proper records.

## Legal Requirements for Invoices in Germany

German tax law (Umsatzsteuergesetz) specifies exactly what must be included on every invoice. Missing information can result in your invoice being rejected for tax purposes.

### Mandatory Information

Every invoice must include:

1. **Your business information**
   - Full name or company name
   - Complete address (street, city, postal code)
   - Tax number (Steuernummer)
   - VAT ID (Umsatzsteuer-ID), if registered for VAT

2. **Client information**
   - Client's name
   - Client's address
   - For B2B invoices: Client's VAT ID (if applicable)

3. **Invoice details**
   - Unique invoice number
   - Invoice date
   - Service date or period (when service was provided)
   - Payment due date (optional but recommended)

4. **Service description**
   - Clear description of services provided
   - Quantity (if applicable)
   - Unit price
   - Total amount per line item

5. **Financial information**
   - Net amount (if VAT applies)
   - VAT rate (19% or 7%, if applicable)
   - VAT amount (if applicable)
   - Total amount including VAT (or total if no VAT)

6. **Payment information**
   - Payment method
   - Bank account details (IBAN and BIC)
   - Payment terms (e.g., "Payment due within 14 days")

## Invoice Numbering

### Requirements

- **Sequential numbering**: Invoice numbers must be consecutive
- **No gaps**: You cannot skip numbers
- **Unique**: Each invoice must have a unique number
- **Format**: You can use any format (e.g., RE-2024-001, INV-001, 2024/001)

### Best Practices

**Use a logical system:**
- Include year: RE-2024-001, RE-2024-002
- Include month: RE-2024-09-001
- Simple sequential: 001, 002, 003

**Avoid:**
- Reusing numbers
- Starting over each year (continue sequence)
- Using client names in numbers (privacy concern)

### What to Do If You Make a Mistake

If you need to correct an invoice:
- Create a new invoice with a new number
- Reference the original invoice number
- Mark it as "Correction" or "Credit Note"
- Keep both invoices in your records

## VAT on Invoices

### If Using Kleinunternehmerregelung

Your invoice must state:
- "Kleinunternehmer gemäß §19 UStG"
- No VAT amount shown
- Total price is final

**Example:**
```
Total: 1,000.00 EUR
Umsatzsteuer: Nicht anwendbar (Kleinunternehmer gemäß §19 UStG)
```

### If Registered for VAT

Your invoice must show:
- Net amount (before VAT)
- VAT rate (19% or 7%)
- VAT amount
- Gross total (including VAT)

**Example:**
```
Net amount: 840.34 EUR
VAT (19%): 159.66 EUR
Total: 1,000.00 EUR
```

## Invoice Templates

### Essential Elements

A professional invoice template should include:

**Header:**
- Your logo (optional but professional)
- Business name and address
- Contact information (phone, email)

**Invoice Details:**
- Invoice number
- Invoice date
- Payment due date
- Client information

**Service Details:**
