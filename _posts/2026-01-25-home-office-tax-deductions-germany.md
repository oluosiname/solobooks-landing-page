Working from home has become the norm for many freelancers in Germany. Whether you have a dedicated home office or just work from your kitchen table, you can deduct home office expenses from your taxes. However, the rules are specific, and understanding them can save you hundreds or even thousands of euros per year.

The German tax system offers two main methods for deducting home office expenses: the simplified home office allowance (Homeoffice-Pauschale) and the actual cost method (tatsächliche Kostenmethode). Each has its advantages, and choosing the right one for your situation can significantly impact your tax savings.

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about home office tax deductions in Germany, from the basics to advanced strategies for maximizing your savings.

## Why Home Office Deductions Matter

For freelancers, home office expenses can be one of the largest deductible expenses. Properly claiming these deductions can:

- **Reduce your taxable income**: Lower taxes mean more money in your pocket
- **Offset the costs of working from home**: Rent, utilities, and other expenses become partially deductible
- **Maximize your tax savings**: Understanding the rules helps you claim everything you're entitled to

However, many freelancers miss out on these deductions because they don't understand the rules or think the process is too complicated. With the right knowledge, claiming home office deductions is straightforward and can save you significant money.

## The Two Methods: Simplified vs. Actual Costs

German tax law offers two methods for deducting home office expenses:

### 1. Simplified Home Office Allowance (Homeoffice-Pauschale)

The simplified method is the easiest way to claim home office deductions. It was introduced in 2020 and made permanent in 2023.

**How It Works:**
- You can deduct 6 EUR per day you work from home
- Maximum: 1,260 EUR per year (210 working days × 6 EUR)
- No need to prove actual costs
- No need to have a dedicated room

**Requirements:**
- You must work from home (not just occasionally)
- The work must be your main professional activity
- You don't need a separate room - any workspace at home qualifies

**Advantages:**
- Simple and straightforward
- No documentation required
- No need to calculate actual costs
- Works for any home workspace

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited to 1,260 EUR per year
- May be less than actual costs for some freelancers
- Cannot combine with actual cost method

**Who Should Use This:**
- Freelancers who work from home regularly
- Those who don't want to track detailed expenses
- People with smaller home offices
- Those whose actual costs are less than 1,260 EUR/year

### 2. Actual Cost Method (Tatsächliche Kostenmethode)

The actual cost method allows you to deduct the actual expenses of your home office, which can be significantly more than the simplified allowance.

**How It Works:**
- You calculate the actual costs of your home office
- Costs are allocated based on the percentage of your home used for business
- You can deduct a portion of rent, utilities, insurance, and other expenses

**Requirements:**
- You must have a dedicated room used exclusively for business
- The room must be used regularly for work
- You cannot use the room for personal purposes

**Advantages:**
- Can result in much higher deductions
- More accurate reflection of actual costs
- Can include all home-related expenses

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex calculations
- Requires detailed documentation
- Must have a dedicated room
- More likely to be audited

**Who Should Use This:**
- Freelancers with dedicated home offices
- Those with high rent or utility costs
- People whose actual costs exceed 1,260 EUR/year
- Those comfortable with detailed record-keeping

## Understanding the Simplified Allowance

The simplified home office allowance is the most popular method because of its simplicity. Here's how to use it:

### Calculating Your Deduction

**Basic Calculation:**
- Count the days you worked from home in the tax year
- Multiply by 6 EUR per day
- Maximum: 1,260 EUR (210 days)

**Example:**
- Worked from home 180 days in 2025
- Deduction: 180 × 6 EUR = 1,080 EUR

### What Counts as "Working from Home"

The tax office considers you to be working from home if:
- You perform your main professional work at home
- You have a workspace at home (doesn't need to be a separate room)
- You work from home regularly (not just occasionally)

**Important:** You cannot claim the allowance if you only work from home occasionally or if your main workplace is elsewhere (like a client's office).

### Documentation Requirements

While the simplified method doesn't require detailed receipts, you should:
- Keep a record of days worked from home
- Be able to explain why you work from home
- Have evidence of your home workspace (photos, etc.)

## Understanding the Actual Cost Method

The actual cost method is more complex but can result in much higher deductions. Here's how it works:

### Step 1: Determine Your Home Office Percentage

First, calculate what percentage of your home is used for business:

**Calculation:**
- Measure the area of your home office (in square meters)
- Measure the total area of your home (in square meters)
- Divide: Home office area ÷ Total home area = Business percentage

**Example:**
- Home office: 15 m²
- Total home: 60 m²
- Business percentage: 15 ÷ 60 = 25%

### Step 2: Identify Deductible Expenses

You can deduct a portion of the following expenses:

**Rent (Miete):**
- If you rent, you can deduct a percentage of your rent
- Based on your business percentage

**Utilities (Nebenkosten):**
- Electricity
- Heating
- Water
- Internet (if used for business)
- Phone (if used for business)

**Insurance (Versicherungen):**
- Home insurance
- Liability insurance (if business-related)

**Depreciation (Abschreibung):**
- If you own your home, you can depreciate a portion
- Based on the business percentage

**Other Expenses:**
- Cleaning (if for business area)
- Repairs and maintenance (if for business area)
- Property tax (if you own)

### Step 3: Calculate Your Deduction

**Example Calculation:**
- Business percentage: 25%
- Annual rent: 12,000 EUR
- Annual utilities: 2,400 EUR
- Annual internet: 600 EUR
- Annual insurance: 300 EUR

**Deduction:**
- Rent: 12,000 × 25% = 3,000 EUR
- Utilities: 2,400 × 25% = 600 EUR
- Internet: 600 × 25% = 150 EUR
- Insurance: 300 × 25% = 75 EUR
- **Total deduction: 3,825 EUR**

### Requirements for Actual Cost Method

To use the actual cost method, you must:

1. **Have a dedicated room**: The room must be used exclusively for business
2. **Regular use**: You must use it regularly for work (not just occasionally)
3. **No personal use**: The room cannot be used for personal purposes
4. **Proper documentation**: Keep receipts and records of all expenses

**Important Restrictions:**
- If the room is used for both business and personal purposes, you cannot use the actual cost method
- You must be able to prove the room is used exclusively for business
- Mixed-use rooms disqualify you from this method

## Choosing the Right Method

Deciding between the simplified allowance and actual cost method depends on your situation:

### Choose Simplified Allowance If:
- You don't have a dedicated home office room
- Your actual costs are less than 1,260 EUR/year
- You want simplicity and minimal documentation
- You work from a shared space (like kitchen table)

### Choose Actual Cost Method If:
- You have a dedicated room used exclusively for business
- Your actual costs exceed 1,260 EUR/year
- You're comfortable with detailed record-keeping
- You want to maximize your deductions

### Comparison Example

**Scenario:** Freelancer with 20 m² home office in 80 m² apartment

**Simplified Method:**
- 180 working days × 6 EUR = 1,080 EUR deduction

**Actual Cost Method:**
- Business percentage: 20 ÷ 80 = 25%
- Annual rent: 14,400 EUR × 25% = 3,600 EUR
- Annual utilities: 2,400 EUR × 25% = 600 EUR
- Annual internet: 720 EUR × 25% = 180 EUR
- **Total: 4,380 EUR deduction**

In this case, the actual cost method saves 3,300 EUR more in deductions!

## Additional Deductible Expenses

Beyond the basic home office deduction, you can also deduct:

### Office Equipment and Furniture

**Fully Deductible:**
- Desk, chair, filing cabinets
- Computer, monitor, keyboard
- Printer, scanner
- Office supplies

**Depreciable:**
- Expensive equipment (over 800 EUR net)
- Furniture (if over threshold)

### Business-Related Expenses

**Internet and Phone:**
- If used primarily for business, can be 100% deductible
- If mixed use, deduct business percentage

**Software and Subscriptions:**
- Accounting software
- Cloud storage
- Professional subscriptions

**Professional Development:**
- Online courses
- Webinars
- Training materials

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Many freelancers make these mistakes with home office deductions:

### 1. Not Claiming at All
- Many freelancers don't realize they can claim home office expenses
- Even a small deduction is better than nothing
- The simplified method makes it easy

### 2. Using Wrong Method
- Choosing simplified when actual costs would be higher
- Not understanding the requirements for actual cost method
- Missing out on significant savings

### 3. Insufficient Documentation
- Not keeping records of days worked from home
- Not having receipts for actual cost method
- Unable to prove business use of space

### 4. Claiming Personal Expenses
- Trying to deduct personal expenses as business
- Not properly allocating mixed-use expenses
- This can lead to tax penalties

### 5. Not Understanding Requirements
- Claiming actual cost method without dedicated room
- Not meeting the "exclusive use" requirement
- This can result in denied deductions

## Documentation and Record-Keeping

Proper documentation is essential for home office deductions:

### For Simplified Allowance:
- Calendar or log of days worked from home
- Photos of your workspace
- Explanation of why you work from home

### For Actual Cost Method:
- Receipts for all expenses (rent, utilities, etc.)
- Floor plan showing home office area
- Photos of dedicated workspace
- Records of business use
- Calculations of business percentage

### Best Practices:
- Keep all receipts organized
- Take photos of your workspace
- Maintain a log of work-from-home days
- Keep records for at least 10 years (German requirement)

## Special Situations

### Renting vs. Owning

**If You Rent:**
- You can deduct a percentage of rent
- Include utilities and other rental costs
- Simpler than owning

**If You Own:**
- You can depreciate a portion of your home
- More complex calculations
- May have capital gains implications when selling
- Consult a tax advisor

### Multiple Workspaces

If you work from multiple locations:
- You can only claim one home office deduction
- Choose the method that gives you the highest deduction
- You cannot claim multiple home offices

### Shared Workspace

If you share your home office with a spouse or partner:
- Each person can claim their own deduction
- Must be able to prove separate business use
- More complex - consult a tax advisor

## Tax Return Filing

When filing your tax return, home office deductions go in different sections:

### Simplified Allowance:
- Enter in the "Werbungskosten" section
- Use line for "Homeoffice-Pauschale"
- Enter total days × 6 EUR

### Actual Cost Method:
- Enter in "Werbungskosten" section
- Break down by expense category
- Include calculations and documentation

### Using Tax Software:
- Most German tax software (like WISO Steuer, Taxfix) includes home office sections
- Guides you through the process
- Helps ensure you don't miss anything

## Maximizing Your Deductions

To maximize your home office deductions:

1. **Choose the right method**: Compare simplified vs. actual costs
2. **Keep good records**: Document everything
3. **Claim all expenses**: Don't miss deductible items
4. **Understand the rules**: Know what qualifies
5. **Consult a tax advisor**: For complex situations

## Conclusion

Home office tax deductions can significantly reduce your tax burden as a freelancer in Germany. The simplified allowance makes it easy for most freelancers to claim deductions, while the actual cost method offers the potential for much higher savings for those with dedicated home offices.

The key is understanding which method works best for your situation and keeping proper documentation. Even if you only qualify for the simplified allowance, claiming 1,260 EUR per year can save you hundreds of euros in taxes.

Don't leave money on the table - take advantage of the home office deductions you're entitled to. With proper planning and documentation, maximizing these deductions is straightforward and well worth the effort.
