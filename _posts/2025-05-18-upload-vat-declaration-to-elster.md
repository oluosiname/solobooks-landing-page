# How to Upload Your VAT Report to Elster Using SoloBooks

## Overview

SoloBooks can submit your VAT advance returns (Umsatzsteuervoranmeldung) directly to Elster, Germany's tax authority system. This guide covers the process.

## Prerequisites

Before submitting:

1. **Pro subscription**: Direct submission requires a Pro plan

2. **VAT status configured**: Your VAT registration details must be set up in SoloBooks

3. **Tax number**: Your German tax number must be in your profile

4. **Report ready**: The report period must have ended (you'll see a "Ready" status)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Navigate to Tax Management

1. Go to **Taxes** in the main navigation

2. Open the **VAT (Value Added Tax)** section

3. Use the **Upcoming** tab to see reports ready for submission

### Step 2: Review Your Report

Before submitting, review the data:

1. Click **Preview** on the report card

2. Review:

   - Domestic sales and VAT

   - EU B2B transactions

   - EU expenses

   - Non-EU transactions

3. Close the preview when done

### Step 3: Test Submission (Recommended)

Test submissions help verify everything works without submitting to Elster:

1. Click **Test** on the report card

2. A modal shows the PDF receipt you would receive

3. Review the PDF to confirm the data

4. If correct, proceed with the real submission

**Note**: Test submissions don't affect your tax records and don't save the PDF to your report.

### Step 4: Submit to Elster

1. Click **Submit** on the report card

2. Confirm when prompted

3. Wait a few seconds while SoloBooks:

   - Generates the XML

   - Submits to Elster

   - Retrieves the confirmation PDF

4. You'll see a success message when complete

### Step 5: Access Your Submitted Files

After submission:

1. Go to the **Submitted** tab

2. Find your report

3. You can download:

   - **XML**: The submitted XML file

   - **View PDF**: The Elster confirmation PDF (only available after submitting through SoloBooks)

## Understanding Report Status

Reports show different statuses:

- **Draft**: Not yet ready (period hasn't ended)

- **Ready**: Period has ended; you can submit

- **Submitted**: Successfully submitted to Elster

- **Error**: Submission failed (check the error message)

## What Happens During Submission

1. **XML generation**: SoloBooks creates the Elster-compliant XML from your data

2. **Submission**: The XML is sent to Elster via the Eric API

3. **Confirmation**: Elster returns a PDF receipt

4. **Storage**: The XML and PDF are saved to your report

## Two Ways to Handle Your VAT Report

### Option 1: Submit Directly Through SoloBooks (Recommended)

- **What it does**: Submits your report to Elster automatically

- **What you get**: 

  - XML file saved to your report

  - PDF confirmation receipt saved to your report

  - Report status updated to "Submitted"

- **Requirements**: Pro subscription

- **Best for**: Most users who want a complete digital record

### Option 2: Download XML and Submit Manually

- **What it does**: Downloads the XML file for you to upload manually through the Elster portal

- **What you get**: 

  - XML file downloaded to your computer

  - **No PDF receipt** (you'll need to get this from Elster's portal)

  - Report status shows "XML Generated" (not "Submitted")

- **Requirements**: None (available to all users)

- **Best for**: Users who prefer manual submission or don't have a Pro subscription

**Important**: If you download the XML and submit manually, you won't get a PDF receipt saved in SoloBooks. You'll need to download the confirmation PDF from Elster's portal separately.

## Troubleshooting

### "Submit" Button Not Visible

- Ensure you have a **Pro subscription**

- The report must show **"Ready"** status (period must have ended)

### Submission Failed

If you see an error:

1. Check the error message

2. Verify your VAT status and tax number are correct

3. Try a test submission first

4. Contact support if issues persist

### Can't See Test Submission PDF

- The PDF may take a moment to load

- Refresh and try again

- If it still fails, contact support

### No PDF After Downloading XML

- **This is expected**: Downloading XML manually does not generate a PDF

- PDF receipts are only available when you submit through SoloBooks

- If you submitted manually, download the PDF from Elster's portal

## Important Notes

- **Test first**: Use test submission to verify data before submitting

- **One-time action**: Submissions cannot be undone

- **Keep records**: Download and save the XML and PDF receipts

- **Deadlines**: Submit by the due date to avoid penalties

- **Pro feature**: Direct submission requires a Pro subscription

- **PDF availability**: PDF receipts are only saved when you submit through SoloBooks, not when downloading XML manually

## After Submission

Once submitted through SoloBooks:

1. The report moves to the **Submitted** tab

2. Status changes to **"Submitted"**

3. Submission date is recorded

4. You can download both the XML and PDF anytime

If you downloaded XML and submitted manually:

1. The report stays in the **Upcoming** tab with status "XML Generated"

2. You'll need to download the PDF from Elster's portal separately

3. Consider updating the report status manually for your records

## Need Help?

- **Preview your data** before submitting

- **Use test submission** to verify everything works

- **Check your VAT status** settings if submission fails

- **Contact support** if you encounter errors
