If you're a freelancer or self-employed in Germany, you're required to submit a **VAT declaration (Umsatzsteuer-Voranmeldung)** to the German tax office (Finanzamt) — often monthly or quarterly. In this guide, we'll walk you through how to export your VAT data from Solobooks and upload it to **ELSTER**, the official online tax portal.

## What You'll Need

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An **ELSTER account** (with login or certificate)
- Your **VAT summary** (exported from Solobooks)
- Your tax number (**Steuernummer**)

## Step 1: Export Your VAT Report from Solobooks

1. Log in to your Solobooks account
2. Navigate to **Transactions** → **VAT Export**
3. Select the desired period (e.g. Q1 2024)
4. Click **Export as CSV**
5. A CSV file with all relevant data will be downloaded

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Solobooks automatically formats your data to match ELSTER's requirements, making the process much smoother.

1. Choose the **reporting period** (e.g. 01.01.2024 – 31.03.2024)
2. Copy the values from your Solobooks CSV into the corresponding fields:

   | ELSTER Field | Description           | Where to Find It       |
   | ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
   | **Line 81**  | VAT on sales          | CSV Column "VAT_Sales" |
   | **Line 66**  | Input tax (Vorsteuer) | CSV Column "Input_Tax" |

3. Double-check that all totals match your records

## Step 4: Submit and Download Confirmation

1. After reviewing, click **"Prüfen"** to validate the form
2. Then click **"Absenden"** to submit
3. Download the **submission receipt (Übertragungsprotokoll)** for your records

## Important Tips to Remember

### 📋 Documentation

- **Always keep a copy** of your submission and the CSV you uploaded
- Store your documents in a secure location for at least 10 years
